*gamifying K-12 STEM education using AI*

---

## 💡 Inspiration
> Our inspiration for *stemlings* was the desire to create a fun service that encourages K-12 students to cultivate an interest in STEM and to encourage them to come back each day to prepare for it.

## ✨ What it does
> *stemlings* provides a website platform for students to login each day and practice solving a daily STEM related problem, generated by AI. In doing so, they can grow their *stemling* and earn accomplishments for their consistent practice.

## ⚒️ How we built it
> We built *stemlings* using **Next.js**, a framework for creating server-rendered React websites, **Tailwind CSS**, a CSS framework with many pre-designed utility classes that can be used to build robust UIs, **Auth0**, an identity and access management (IAM) platform used for authentication and authorization, **.Tech Domains**, Upstash Redis, a cloud-based managed Redis database, and **Vercel**, a cloud platform for deploying web applications.

## 💢 Challenges we ran into
> When using Auth0, we had challenges with navigating the different Development and Production client keys.

## 🥂 Accomplishments that we're proud of

## 🧠 What we learned
